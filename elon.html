      <h2>Elon Musk</h2>
    </div>
    <div >
      <p>Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, to Maye (n√©e Haldeman), a model, and Errol Musk, 
        a businessman and engineer. Musk briefly attended the University of Pretoria before immigrating
         to Canada at the age of 18, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. 
         Two years later he matriculated at Queen's University at Kingston in Canada. Musk later transferred
          to the University of Pennsylvania and received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved 
          to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University, but dropped out after two days and, with his brother Kimbal,
           co-founded the online city guide software company Zip2. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999.
            That same year Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank. X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. 
            In October 2002, eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion. Using $100 million of the money he made from the sale of PayPal,
             Musk founded SpaceX, a spaceflight services company, in 2002.
